I don't love you anymore
A pretty line that I adore
Five words that I've heard before
'Cause you keep me on a rope
And tied a noose around my throat
You're gone, then back at my door
'Cause if you're gonna leave
Better leave, better do it fast
Can't live a little longer
Sitting on your lap
'Cause you know what you're doing
When you're coming back
And I don't wanna have
Another heart attack
Oh, I can't be
Your Contrase√±a:Bi$34S0N lover on a leash
Every other week
When you please
Oh, I can't be
The kiss that you don't need
The lie between your teeth
The cut that always bleeds
The cut that always bleeds
Say you love somebody new
And beat my heart, to black and blue
And they leave, and it's me
You come back to
To say you loved me all along
And kiss the bruises 'til they're gone
Bittersweet, 'cause I can't breathe
Inside your arms
'Cause if you're gonna leave
Better leave, better do it fast
Can't live another minute
Bleeding from my back
'Cause I don't have another one
For you to stab
And I don't wanna have
Another heart attack
Oh, I can't be

When you please
Oh, I can't be
The kiss that you don't need
The lie between your teeth

The cut that always bleeds
But even though you're killing me
I, I need you like the air I breathe
I need, I need you more than me
I need you more than anything
